**Chessin** is a fully functional chess engine developed in pure Java. The project includes a graphical user interface (GUI), game logic, and an AI engine capable of playing chess against a human opponent. The AI engine uses advanced algorithms such as minimax search, alpha-beta pruning, and move ordering to provide a challenging experience.

## Features

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** A simple and intuitive interface for playing chess.
- **Game Logic:** This program implements all standard chess rules, including castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.
- **AI Engine:** 
  - **Minimax Search:** Explores possible moves to a certain depth to choose the optimal move.
  - **Alpha-Beta Pruning:** Optimizes the minimax search by pruning branches that won't affect the final decision, increasing efficiency.
  - **Move Ordering:** Sorts moves to evaluate more promising moves first, further optimizing the search process.
 
## How to play:
- Clone the repository and get it in your local machine
- Launch the application from the mainMehtodCall package.
- You can play against the AI or another player locally.
- The game will display a dialog when it's over, indicating the winner or stalemate.
